PREFACE.


“_Learn a foreign language as you learned your mother-tongue._” It is
the way that nature herself follows, it is the same which the mother
points out in speaking to her child, repeating to it a hundred times
the same words, combining them imperceptibly and succeeding in this
way in making it speak the same language she speaks. To learn in this
manner is no longer a study, it is an amusement. This is in a few
words the Method which Prof. =Ahn= has so successfully adopted in his
continental Grammars.

The Editor of this Grammar has followed the rational System, which has
already procured for Prof. =Ahn= a European reputation, and he has
adopted it for the Study of the Portuguese Language. He is greatly
indebted to the excellent Grammars by =Bösche=, =Müller=, etc., which
he has used for the ground work of this Grammar and it is hoped that
its simplicity and utility will procure for it that favour, which the
German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Dutch and Latin
Grammars of Prof. =Ahn= have already found in the Colleges and Schools
of England.

FIRST COURSE.




The Pronunciation.


=1. The Alphabet.=

The Portuguese Alphabet is composed of the 25 following letters:

        pronounced    |        pronounced
    _a_   ah          |    _n_   ennay
    _b_   bay         |    _o_   o
    _c_   say         |    _p_   pay
    _d_   day         |    _q_   kay
    _e_   ai          |    _r_   erray
    _f_   effay       |    _s_   essay
    _g_   jay         |    _t_   tay
    _h_   aghah       |    _u_   oo
    _i_   ee          |    _v_   vay
    _j_   dshod       |    _x_   shees
    _k_   kah         |    _y_   ypsilon
    _l_   ellay       |    _z_   zea.
    _m_   emmay       |

There are six vowels: _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_ and _y_, the rest are
consonants.

=2. The Accent.=

The Portuguese language has several accents:

    the ʹ acute accent,
    the ^ circumflex accent,
    the ~ hyphen, called _til_, is set over some letters
          as a substitute for _m_, as:
              _lã_ for _lam_
              _bẽ_ for _bem_
              _huã_ for _huam_.

=3. The Vowels.=

    =A= 1. is pronounced like the _a_ in the English word
                 =path=, when it has the acute accent ´:
                   _chá_, tea
                   _dá_,  he gives
                   _lá_,  there.

    2. is it pronounced short and clear like the _a_ in
       =father=:
               _capitão_, the captain (first a),
       or if found before the double consonants:
           _cc_, _ll_, _mm_, _nn_, _pp_, _ss_, _tt_, as:
                   _acclamar_, to call out
                   _annullar_, to annull
                   _alludir_,  to allude
                   _appellar_, to appeal.

    3. it has a soft and aspirated sound at the end of words if not
       accentuated: _vergonha_, the shame. If the hyphen ~ _til_
       stands over the _a_ it takes a nasal sound:

                   _irmãa_ (pr. irmāng), the sister
                   _lã_    (pr. lāng), the world.

    =E= has three sounds:
    1. open but short like _ai_ in the English word =hail=,
       when with the acute accent ´ as:
                   _pé_, foot
                   _fé_, belief
                   _sé_,

       or in:
                   _mel_, honey
                   _he_, he is
                   _quero_ (pr. kayro), I will,

       or in those verbs ending in _er_:
                   _conhecer_, to know
                   _receber_, to receive.

    2. long, when with the circumflex ^ over it, as:
                   _lê_, he reads
                   _vê_, he sees
                   _rêde_, the net.

    3. It is almost mute at the end of words without the accent, as:
                   _liberdade_, liberty
                   _amizade_, friendship.

    =I= is pronounced like _e_ in the English word =me=, and it
           is only the accent that determines the pronunciation, as:
                   _tímido_,
                   _timoré_,
                   _difficil_,
                   _javalí_.

    =O= has three sounds:

    1. clear and strong in:
                   _mólho_,
                   _dó_.

    2. soft and long in:
                   _bôlo_, cake
                   _gôrdo_, fat
                   _rapôsa_, the fox (fem.).

    3. quite short, almost like _oo_ in:
                   _poder_, to be able
                   _molho_, a bundle almost pronounced like
                                 _molyou_.

    =U= is pronounced like the _oo_ in the word =wood=, but the
             pronunciation depends much upon the length of the
             syllables, f. i. in _túmulo_, the grave, the first _u_
             is long, the second is short. If provided with the _til_
             ~ and before _m_ and _n_ it takes the nasal sound.

    If it follows after _g_ and _q_, it is either aspirated,
             or it is quite mute, as:
                   _guerra_ (gerrah), war
                   _quero_  (kayro), I will
                   _quieto_ (key-eh-to), quite.

    In _qual_, it is slightly sounded to distinguish it from the
        Noun _cal_, the chalk.

    =Y= is pronounced like the vowel _I_.

=4. The Consonants.=

    =B= is pronounced like the English _B_.

    =C= before _a_, _o_, _u_, _l_ and _r_ is pronounced like _k_, as:
                   _cavallo_ (kahvallo), the horse
                   _cravo_   (krahvo), the pink
                   _cuidado_ (kooeedado), the care.

             Before _e_ and _i_ it sounds like _s_, as:
                   _ceo_     (sayo), heaven
                   _cigarro_ (seegarro), cigar.

              If the _c_ before _a_, _o_, _u_ has a cedille (_ç_)
                 it sounds like _s_, as:
                   _caça_   (kassah), chase
                   _aço_    (asso), the steel
                   _açucar_ (assookar), sugar.

              The double _c_, is distinctly heard only before _e_ and
                _i_, the first sounds like _k_, the second like _s_, as:
                   _accidente_ (akseedente), the accident.

    =D= is pronounced like the English.

    =F=        do.               do.

             like the English _g_, as:
                   _gordo_, fat
                   _gravo_, grave.

             _g_ before _e_ and _i_ sounds like the
             _j_ in the English word =joy=, as:
                   _general_.

             _gua_ almost sounds like the English _wa_, as:
                   _guarda_, pr. gwarda.

    =H= is only softly aspirated in few words, as:
                   _anhelar_,
                   _hálito_;
              otherwise it is mute, as:
                   _homem_ (omem), man
                   _hora_ (ora), hour.
               Many writers drop the _h_ at the beginning and write
                    _um_, _uma_, instead of: _hum_, _huma_.

    =J= is pronounced like the English _j_.

    =K= only occurs in foreign words and is pronounced like the
             English _K._

                   _amar_, to love.
          It takes a nasal sound at the end of words, or when it follows
           after _a, e, i, o_ or _u_ which cannot well be described, as:
                   _condição_,   condition
                   _bem_ (bang), well
                   _bom_ (bong), good.

        3. Between two vowels it is pronounced like _gz_, as:
                   _exactamente_,
                   _exornar_,
            except in:
                   _paixão_,
                   _puxo_,
                   _Alexandre_,
                   _baixo_,
                   and some other words, where it sounds like _sh._
            The _x_ must be pronounced so softly that it is
                 scarcely audible.

    =Z= sounds like the English, as:
                   _zelo_,

before or after the Verb, and one may therefore say either: _eu me
lembro_, or _eu lembro-me_, _eu me lembrava_ and _eu lembrava-me_, but
in the compound tenses as well as in the Subjunctive and Imperative
Mood they must stand before the Verb, as: _eu me tenho lembrado_, _que
eu me lembre_, _que eu me lembrasse_.

a pratica[593] que tiverão, lhe perguntou[594] o duque que fidalgos

Christovão Colon foi o primeiro que com audaz[604] fortaleza[605]
navegou o oceano, o descobrio[606] as Indias de Castella; pelo que
mereceo que os Reis Catholicos o fizessem duque de Beraguas. Estava
uma noite[607] ceando[608] com outros cavalheiros seus amigos; e
dizendo-lhe um que aquella façanha a poderia obrar qualquer outro, se
lhe dessem o socorro[609], que fosse necessario, dissimulou Christovão
Colon, e tirando um ovo[610] do prato, perguntou aos demais fidalgos
se poderia algum fazer que aquelle ovo estivesse levantado[611], sem
que se arrimasse[612] a cousa alguma? Respondêrão todos, que não
podia ser[613]. Pegou[614] no ovo Christovão Colon, e dando com elle
mansamente[615] na mesa[616], lhe fez uma pequena[617] móssa[618], e o
póz muito direito. Rírão-se[619] todos, e disse Colon: “Nenhum[620] de

Querendo certo homem desquitar-se[631] de sua mulher, com quem tinha
pouca paz[632], appareceo[633] para este fim[634] diante[635] do
Provisor. Estranhou[636] elle a proposta[637], porque conhecia a
mulher, e era de boas qualidades: “Porque quereis deixar[638] vossa
mulher?” (lhe perguntou o Provisor): “Não he virtuosa?”—“Sim, senhor”;
respondeo o homem.—“Não he rica?”—“Sim, senhor.” Emfim[639] a todas
as cousas, sobre que era perguntado, respondia em abono seu. Com que
lhe disse o Provisor: “Pois se vossa mulher tem tantas cousas boas,
porque quereis desquitar-vos della?” A isto o homem, descalçando[640]
um sapato[641], perguntou ao Provisor: “Senhor, este sapato não he
novo?”—“Sim”, respondeo o Provisor. Accrescentou[642]: “não está bem
feito[643]?”—“Sim, ao que parece”, respondeo o Provisor.—“Não he de
bom cordavão, e de boa sola?”—Respondeo do mesmo modo que sim. “Pois
vê Vossa Mercê com tudo isso[644]” (disse o descontente marido[645]),
“pois eu quero tirar este sapato, e calçar outro, porque eu sei muito

=Botocudos.=

Estes Indios dominão[649] na cordilheira[650] habitada[651] por seus
maiores[652] os Aimorés, de cuja[653] barbaridade ainda guardão
sementes. Quando os Portuguezes começárão[654] a povoar[655] o Brazil
tiverão de guerrear com os ferozes[656] Aimorés, a quem dizem[657]
que derão[658] o nome de Botocudos, de boto, e codea[659], por
isso que os Indios desta nação[660] erão rolhos, e trazião[661]
o corpo[662] coberto d’uma codea de gomma[663] copal com que se
pintavão[664] para se preservarem das ferretoadas[665] dos mosquitos
e outros insectos. Os Botocudos são mais brancos[666] que a maior
parte dos demais[667] Indios do Brazil, porém, como seus ascendentes
os Aimorés, costumão[668] pintar a cara[669] e mais partes do corpo.
Dividem-se em varias tribus ou cabildas[670], cada[671] uma com seu
cabo[672], que tem um poder[673] absoluto sobre os seus[674] em os
negocios de maior importancia como são a caça[675], a guerra[676] e
a escolha[677] de uma nova morada[678]; mas na aldea[679] limita-se
toda a sua autoridade a compôr as desavenças que são entre elles mui
frequentes. Este lugar não he hereditario, escolhe-se para elle o mais
bravo, e por vezes[680] o mais atrevido[681] se proclama por chefe da
tribu, sobre tudo se por ventura o que os commandava vem a morrer.
Os Botocudos tem as espadoas[682] largas, o pescoço[683] curto, o
nariz[684] chato, as maçãas[685] do rosto proeminentes, os pés[686]
pequenos, as extremidades inferiores delgadas[687], mas nervosas. Furão
as orelhas[688], e o beiço inferior[689], e enfião no buraco[690] uma
rodella de páo[691]. São vingativos[692] e traidores[693], posto que
tinhão um exterior alegre e um ar[694] de franqueza. Não tem especie
alguma de culto; considerão[695] o sol[696] como uma divindade a que
chamão[697], e reverenceão ainda mais a lua[698], quando com sua luz
os protege em suas excursões nocturnas. Amão e imitão as ceremonias
religiosas dos christãos, quanto isto póde compadecer-se com a vida
nomada que fazem, assim que são de todos os Indios os que mais custão a
civilizar-se.

=As grutas=[699] =do inferno=[700].

Deo-se[701] este nome ás cavernas naturaes que se achão[702] na
montanha em que estão assentadas a povoação e fortaleza[703] da
Nova-Coimbra, na provincia de Mato-Grosso e sobre a margem direita[704]
do Paraguai. No vertente[705] septentrional[706] da montanha existe
uma abertura que dá passo[707] a duas especies de antecamaras, 1 de
braça[708] e meia de comprido[709], e 1 de largo[710], e outra algum
tanto maior. Desce-se para ellas por uma ladeira que tem obra de 20
braças de comprimento[711], guarnecida de estalactitas, que provêm
da filtração continua da abobada. No cabo[712] da ladeira entra-se
n’uma salla parecida com uma mesquita[713], de cuja abobada pendem
estalactitas de differentes fórmas e tamanhos[714], e o mesmo se
observa no chão. A’ esquerda[715] a parede se acha revestida d’uma
incrustação d’espalto, que com o reflexo da luz arremeda uma soberba
cascata. Póde esta salla ter 50 braças de comprido e 1S de largo,
e no fundo della existe um espaço de 6 braças pelo menos coberto
d’agua limpida porém de máo sabor[716], que dá da parte de fóra[717]
origem a um ribeiro[718] represado frequentemente pelas aguas do
Paraguai, nas cheias[719] que alagão todos os annos por varias vezes

em sua companhia o naturalista Alexandre Rodriguez Ferreira que as
debuxou[723] e descreveo[724]. Em 1795, varias pessoas[725] curiosas

formavão havião jacarés[726], e que um d’elles tinha uma pata de menos.
